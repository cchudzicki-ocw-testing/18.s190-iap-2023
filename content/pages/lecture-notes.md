### Lecture 1: Motivation, Intuition, and Examples

Lecture 1: Motivation, Intuition, and Examples (PDF)

{{% resource_link "2a25c5c5-2012-44c3-acf9-e922852d4b38" "Lecture 1: Motivation, Intuition, and Examples (TEX)" %}}

Outline: Motivation, definition, and intuition behind metric spaces. Redefining *18.100A Real Analysis* and *18.100P Real Analysis* in terms of metrics: open/closed sets, convergence, Cauchy sequences, and continuity. 

### Lecture 2: General Theory

Lecture 2: General Theory (PDF)

{{% resource_link "c843f653-e999-4734-8362-af31c2154a12" "Lecture 2: General Theory (TEX)" %}}

Outline: Some general theory of metric spaces regarding convergence, open and closed sets, continuity, and their relationship to one another. 

### Lecture 3: Compact Sets in Rⁿ

Lecture 3: Compact Sets in Rⁿ (PDF)

{{% resource_link "6884f1a4-d5f7-44a3-ab0f-fff757bfc3d9" "Lecture 3: Compact Sets in Rⁿ (TEX)" %}}

Outline: Norms and analysis on finite sets (as motivation for compact sets). Topological compactness and sequential compactness. Today will focus purely on theorems regarding compact subsets of Rⁿ. The Heine-Borel theorem and the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem. 

### Lecture 4: Compact Metric Spaces

Lecture 4: Compact Metric Spaces (PDF)

{{% resource_link "c54ec5aa-e256-4d99-8252-af92e4b440bc" "Lecture 4: Compact Metric Spaces (TEX)" %}}

Outline: Compact sets on general metric spaces. Showing sequential compactness is equivalent to topological compactness, which is equivalent to being totally bounded and complete (on metric spaces).  

### Lecture 5: Complete Metric Spaces

Lecture 5: Complete Metric Spaces (PDF)

{{% resource_link "5a6eddfa-6dfb-45ec-bca0-06ba8d8ff18b" "Lecture 5: Complete Metric Spaces (TEX)" %}}

Outline: Completions of metric spaces, motivating L<sup>p</sup> spaces, Sobolev spaces, p-adic numbers, Banach spaces, and Hilbert spaces.  

### Lecture 6: Where We Go from Here

Lecture 6: Where We Go from Here (PDF)

{{% resource_link "bd6205e5-d8dc-47f5-af86-a023d20c9df1" "Lecture 6: Where We Go from Here (TEX)" %}}

Outline: How these topics were motivated, and a preview of how these topics come up in later classes.
